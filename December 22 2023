Arrays in Java
int[] a={10,20,30,40};
a.length to get number of items in array.
if we change a[2]=50 it reflects change in the original array

different ways to create an array in java:
--> int[] a={10,20,30,40};
--> int a[]={10,20,30,40};
--> int[] a=new int[4];
    for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
    {
      a[i]=sc.nextInt();
    }
--> int a[]=new int[4];
    for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
    {
      a[i]=sc.nextInt();
    }
--> int[] a;
    a=new int[4];
--> int a[],b here a[] is array and b is int type but
--> int[] a,b here a and b both are array types so be careful while using a[] and int[] a

Note : ->  Not Initialized arrays by default assigned as respective default values. for int it is 0 for float it is 0.0 for boolean it is false
       -> All items should be of same type
       -> Primitive types are stored in contiguous locations in the memory
       -> Non Primitive references are also stored in contiguous location in heap memory
          class Point
          {
            int x,y;
            point(int a ,int b)
            { 
               x=a;
               y=b;
            }
          }
       -> point p[]=(new point(10,20), new point(30,40), new point(50,60));
Address of ith item = address of 1st item + (size of item)*i;
Advantages of Arrays: Random access....cache friendly
Disadvantages of Arrays: Insertion deletion are costly operations, search is slow if array is unsorted 
Types of array on Dimentions: 1D, Multi-Dimentional array
Types of array on Size: Fixed size, Dynamic Sixe (ArrayList,LinkedList)
