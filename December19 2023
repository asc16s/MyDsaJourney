Introduction To Java
--> Java was released in 1995
--> Platform: It's a combination of Operating System and Architecture
--> Why is Java called Platform Independent?
    C and C++ compilers are specific to respective platforms. The program executable file on one platform is completely different from other platform. i.e., the .exe
    file on a platform is completely different from another platform. In Java, the compiler will generate a bytecode executable on all other platforms if and only the 
    JVM package is preinstalled in it. This Bytecode can run on multiple platforms which makes it platform-independent.
--> JVM is a machine-specific software that is responsible for converting the bytecode into machine-specific/platform-specific language. JVM is different for every OS
--> Java has a simple compilation and complex running process. Platform independent idea followed by python, c sharp developed by Microsoft
--> Java is simple & secure because it doesn't have a pointers concept. memory can't be accessed easily. JVM acts as a monitoring manager for us. unsecured things don't
    run with the code in JVM. JVM also acts as Automatic garbage collector.
--> Java is a statistically typed language that is similar point with c and C++, therefore execution speed is high in Java C and C++ as compared with Python javascript
--> Statistically typed: we should declare the datatype of a variable before initializing it.
--> There are many more advantages in Java like multithreading, exceptional handling, automatic garbage collector and codes are maintainable

Java Development Kit should be preinstalled to set the Java environment
JDK Contains JRE & Dev Tools( Dev Tools used for development it contains a list of tools like Java Compiler, Java Document Generator, Java Debugger
JRE Contains JVM & Java Class libraries which are used to run Java Programs
Popular IDE for Executing the programs are IntelliJ, Eclipse, BlueJ
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
--> Everything in Java runs in the class only. we can't run the programs without using classes. program execution starts from the main method. JVM searches for 
    the main method to start the execution of the program.
--> public is an access modifier this makes the method accessible to all other classes and packages. for running the program it should be accessible to the JVM 
therefore it should be public.
--> Static methods are methods that are called without creating objects. main method should be static
--> Void is the return type of method
--> program execution starts with main()
--> String[] is an array of strings that is used for taking arguments into it.
--> System is a class, out is an object of print-stream and println is a method in print-stream class.
--> class name and file name should always be same.
