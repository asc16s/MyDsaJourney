Lambda Expressions:   Are Anonymous fuctions
Anonymous functions:  Functions with no name & we dont need to create class objects to use this functions. Lambda Expressions concept was implemented in java by using functional interface
Functional Interface: An Interface which has exactly one abstract method in it. it may contain 0 or more default methods or static methods within it.
Abstract methods:     Methods in which their implementation is not provided within it are known as abstract methods.

Lambda expressions are implemented by using functional interfaces. Pridicate interface is an example of functional interface.
Syntax of pridicate interface:  interface Pridicate <T>            T can be type. Ex: ArrayList,stack,queue,LinkedList,Hash
                                {
                                      ....
                                      abstract boolean test(T t)
                                }
Runnable interface which is used for multi-threading. we need ti implement the run method
comparable interface which is used to sorting ans other purposes. we only need to implement the compare method, to compare the 2 objects for sorting or binary search purposes
